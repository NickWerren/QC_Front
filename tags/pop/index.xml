      <description>&lt;p&gt;A little while ago, I was having a discussion with my friends in which we attempted to identify the landmark moments in music that defined the last decade. One thing we all agreed upon was that &lt;em&gt;Old Town Road&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;strong&gt;Lil Nas X&lt;/strong&gt; was a cultural touchstone that careered though the musical landscape. This led me to return to the song.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
